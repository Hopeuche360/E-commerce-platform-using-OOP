# E-commerce-platform-using-OOP
Ecommerce platform using OOP in Java project. As a beginner in programming learning Java, I just learnt about OOP principles, exceptions, interfaces, Enums, lists and maps (HashMaps and ArrayLists) and of course good 'ol classes and objects. This project is basically a simple implementation of these concepts and nothing fancy.
